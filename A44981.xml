            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>WEAVERS</hi> of <hi>London</hi> do humbly offer to the ≈øeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Con≈øideration of both Hou≈øes of Parliament;</head>
            <argument>
               <p>That this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> will ≈øu≈øtain great Evils and Damage by enjoyning the Wear of Woollen Manufactures and Leather, both by Men, Women, and Children, by a Law; and ≈øo con≈øequently re≈øtraining the Wear of Silks and Hair Stuffs manufactured in <hi>England;</hi> And that great benefit may en≈øue to the Engli≈øh Nation, by prohibiting the U≈øe and Wear of Silks and Stuffs Foreign manufactur'd, appears by the≈øe following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE <hi>Re≈øtraint</hi> of wearing Silks, and Stuffs made of <hi>Mohair Yarn</hi> manufactured in <hi>England,</hi> will nece≈ø≈øarily impoveri≈øh and depopulate the Nation, there being no Trades in <hi>England</hi> that imploy ≈øo many People as tho≈øe relating to the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturing of Silk and Hair; for upon the mo≈øt mode≈øt computation they are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be above. Three hundred thou≈øand Souls <hi>Weavers, Throw≈øters, Wind≈øters, Dyers,</hi> and other Dependents thereupon, that do ≈øub≈øi≈øt thereby, and that have no other way of Livelyhood; and a great part of the≈øe have ≈øerved ≈øeven years Apprenti≈øhip to their ≈øeveral Trades, according to the Laws of this Nation, (which makes their Trades a Freehold and Inheritance) and have Families depend upon them. Now if by <hi>Law</hi> there ≈øhould be any Re≈øtraint of wearing <hi>Engli≈øh made Silks and Hair Stuffs</hi> for any part of the Year, they would be deprived of their ≈øaid Freehold and Inheritance, and mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity not only be impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed, but want bread in one year, nay the greate≈øt part of them in one Months time, they having nothing but from hand to mouth, and what they get by their daily Labour to ≈øupply their daily Wants; and con≈øequently the greate≈øt part of them mu≈øt be nece≈ø≈øitated in a ≈øhort time either to take rude and de≈øperate cour≈øes, or tran≈øport them≈øelves into Foreign Parts to get their Bread; there being no other Imployment (either Handicraft or others) that can receive one fourth part of ≈øo great a Number, con≈øidering that the <hi>Old and Young</hi> are hereby imployed, and cannot otherwi≈øe, but be chargable to the places of their Abode.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that this <hi>Re≈øtraint</hi> is intended but for five Months in the Year, and therefore cannot have ≈øuch di≈ømal Effects as are before mentioned: For An≈øwer it is ≈øaid, That the≈øe five Months <hi>Re≈øtraint</hi> of wearing them will take off the Imployment of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers thereof eight Months in the Year, and in little time amount to little le≈øs than a total Prohibition of them; for that the per≈øons that wear <hi>Engli≈øh made Silks and Hair Stuffs</hi> are generally of the be≈øt Quality, and all of them either Leaders or Followers of the newe≈øt Modes and Fa≈øhions, and therefore it cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed that they will buy Silk Garments to lay by them all the Winter to wear in Spring, for that then newer Modes and Fa≈øhions will come in, and there cannot be allowed le≈øs (one with another) than three or four Months for them to wear out a Silk Garment: So that take the five Months in the Year wherein they are not to be worn at all, and the three or four Months before, which mu≈øt be allowed for the wearing of tho≈øe they have already bought, there will not remain above three or four Months at mo≈øt for the Manufacturers to ≈øell their Silks and Stuffs; which amounts to little le≈øs than a total Prohibition, for this rea≈øon, for that the Merchants either cannot, or at lea≈øt will not, give credit to the <hi>Weaver or Throw≈øter</hi> the Year round; and if they ≈øhould, yet is there not one <hi>Weaver or Throw≈øter</hi> in a thou≈øand, that is able to ≈øupply their <hi>Workmen and Wind≈øters</hi> with Money ≈øo long time, without Returns of Money for their Commodities, So that it is manife≈øt notwith≈øtanding this Objection, the forementioned mi≈øchiefs of Poverty and Depopulation mu≈øt en≈øue upon it.</p>
            <p>And if it be objected, That it is not intended to re≈øtrain the wear of Stuffs made of <hi>Mohair Yarn,</hi> commonly called <hi>Chamlets,</hi> or other Stuffs, whereof the Woof or Warp ≈øhall be of <hi>Mohair Yarn;</hi> This mu≈øt be acknowledged to be ≈øo, but withall, the≈øe Chamlets and Stuffs are limitted to be u≈øed for Cloaks and Coats for Men only, which do not work up the fourth Part of the Mohair Yarns imported, nor do they imploy one ≈øixth Part of the Hands that Mohair Yarns would imploy; for it is to be noted, that the ≈øeveral Commodities here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after named, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55260:2"/>
            <p>That as this will impoveri≈øh the Manufacturers of <hi>Silk and Hair Stuffs,</hi> ≈øo it will al≈øo dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh the con≈øumption of Wooll, and impoveri≈øh the Manufacturers thereof, and con≈øequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cau≈øe yet a greater Depopulation of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe the greate≈øt part of our Cloths and Stuffs made here of <hi>Engli≈øh Wooll</hi> are tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported beyond the Seas, and chiefly to <hi>Turky;</hi> in exchange whereof the Merchants bring <hi>raw Silks and Mohair Yarn,</hi> which ≈øets ≈øo many thou≈øand people to work again; and if the Con≈øumption of <hi>Silk and Hair</hi> be abated in <hi>England,</hi> as it mu≈øt needs be by the <hi>Re≈øtraint</hi> of the Wear thereof, the Exportation of Cloth mu≈øt needs abate proportionably thereunto, for that there is little other Commodities proper for <hi>England</hi> to be had there in exchange for our Cloths; ≈øo that whereas the <hi>Turky Company</hi> in particular have of late exported twenty five or thirty thou≈øand Cloths in a Year, they may be reduced to ten or twelve thou≈øand, and by degrees to little or nothing; and con≈øequently there will be eighteen or twenty thou≈øand Cloths lie on the Clothiers hands in one Year more than they can vend; and that there will be ≈øuch an Abatement in the Exportation of <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Cloths, if <hi>Engli≈øh made Silks and Hair Stuffs</hi> be not allowed to be worn five Moneths in the Year, will appear not onely from the former Argument, that there are little other Commodities to exchange in <hi>Turky</hi> for them but <hi>Silk and Hair;</hi> but al≈øo becau≈øe the Winter Sea≈øon, wherein the≈øe <hi>Silks and Stuffs</hi> are prohibited to be worn, is the chief time for the Con≈øumption of <hi>Silk and Hair Stuffs,</hi> for that the riche≈øt <hi>Silks and Stuffs</hi> are worn in that ≈øea≈øon, and is the principal time for the Con≈øump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. And if this be true, (as mo≈øt certain it is) that this will cau≈øe ≈øo great an Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Exportation of our Cloths made of <hi>Engli≈øh Wooll,</hi> what mi≈øerable Poverty and De≈øolation will it bring upon the Manufacturers of the Staple Commodity of this Nation, and in little time force them al≈øo to tran≈øport them≈øelves to Forein Parts, to the great Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, Di≈øhonour, and Danger of the Nation; for hereby there will not be People ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to eat up the Corn, nor ≈øtrength to defend the Nation.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That the enjoyning the wearing of Woollen Manufacture five Months in the Year, will an≈øwer the Con≈øumption of Wooll that is abated in the Exportations: It is an≈øwered, That it had need exceed it three times over; for that the making 60000 Cloths in a Year more than now is, will not ≈øet ≈øo many people at work, as the other will throw out of work; and if it could be ≈øuppo≈øed that there would be vent for ≈øo many more, it is pre≈øumed there would not be found Wooll enough to make them, it being now ≈øomewhat a ≈øcarce Commodity, and rai≈øed in price a third part to what it was ≈øome years pa≈øt. So that indeed at this time there is no ju≈øt cau≈øe to complain of the want of Con≈øumption of Wooll, it being a good ≈øcarce and ready money Commodity; but that the <hi>Re≈øtraint of Silk and Hair Stuffs,</hi> and the enjoyning the Wear of Woollen, will neither increa≈øe the Con≈øumption of it to ≈øuch a degree, nor yet an≈øwerable to the Abatement of the Exportation of it by 15 or 20000 Clothes <hi>per annum,</hi> is proved thus; becau≈øe the Nobility, Gentry, and better ≈øort of Trade≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, will not wear our cour≈øe Cloths made of <hi>Engli≈øh Wooll</hi> onely, but fine <hi>Dutch</hi> Cloth, and Cloth made of <hi>Spani≈øh Wooll,</hi> which in ≈øome of the fine≈øt Cloths have not above five or ≈øix pounds of <hi>Engli≈øh Wooll</hi> in a whole Cloth, as the Makers of fine Cloths will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; ≈øo that little <hi>Engli≈øh Wooll</hi> will be con≈øumed by them that u≈øe to wear Silks and Stuffs, and on the other hand the poor Manufacturers both of <hi>Woollen, Silk, and Hair,</hi> they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wear our cour≈øe Cloths and Stuffs made all of <hi>Engli≈øh Wooll,</hi> and the≈øe being either impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veri≈øhed hereby that they cannot cloath them≈øelves but with Rags, or be forc'd beyond the Seas, mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily cau≈øe a far le≈øs Con≈øumption of our <hi>Engli≈øh Wooll.</hi> For it cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed that the expence of <hi>Engli≈øh Wooll</hi> in fine Cloths, can an≈øwer to the lo≈øs of that expence which is now worn by the≈øe poor Creatures. So that indeed the expence of <hi>Engli≈øh Wooll</hi> will by this means be abated in <hi>England</hi> not onely ≈øo much, but much more than what the Abatements of the Exportations of our Woollen Manufactures amount unto, by means of ≈øuch a <hi>Re≈øtraint</hi> of the one, and enjoyning the other.</p>
            <p>That by <hi>Re≈øtraint</hi> of the Wear of any part of Silk, the Con≈øumption of Wooll mu≈øt needs be le≈ø≈øen'd, for that the ≈øeveral Stuffs hereafter mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>This <hi>Injunction</hi> of the one, and <hi>Re≈øtraint</hi> of the other, will much depre≈øs the Prote≈øtant, and advance the Papal Intere≈øt, not only in <hi>England,</hi> but throughout <hi>Europe;</hi> and were it not but that by the unanimous Votes of this pre≈øent <hi>Prote≈øtant Parliament,</hi> wherein (to the chearing of <hi>Engli≈øh Hearts</hi>) they have manife≈øted ≈øo much zeal for the <hi>Prote≈øtant Intere≈øt,</hi> and the Rights and Privileges of <hi>Engli≈øhmen,</hi> it would cau≈øe great ≈øu≈øpicion of ill de≈øigns; for there is nothing more conducing to the de≈øtruction of the <hi>Prote≈øtant Religion,</hi> and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>Popery,</hi> than the di≈øuniting of the Hearts and Affections of the <hi>Engli≈øh people,</hi> who are generally <hi>Prote≈øtants,</hi> and the be≈øt ≈øort of <hi>Prote≈øtants.</hi> And this the <hi>Je≈øuits</hi> have not been wanting by all means to effect, and there is nothing more proper thereunto, than to bring off the Affections of the People from the Love of <hi>Parliaments</hi> by any means what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which they know are the greate≈øt Anticipation and Ob≈øtruction of their damnable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns; but through the mercy of God they have in a great mea≈øure been hitherto prevented, and it's hoped yet will, by a timely pro≈øpect of tho≈øe things that may cau≈øe it. And though it cannot be thought, that any true <hi>Engli≈øhman</hi> would knowingly countenance, but dete≈øt ≈øuch de≈øigns; yet it is feared if ≈øuch an Act ≈øhould pa≈øs, it would not only alienate the Affections of many thou≈øand <hi>Prote≈øtants,</hi> by expo≈øing them to Want and Penury, and to beg their Bread, and ≈øeek it in other Countries; but al≈øo would make this great and populous Nation, (which at pre≈øent under God is the Fortre≈øs of the <hi>Prote≈øtant Religion</hi>) indefen≈øible again≈øt the Papal de≈øigns, by ≈øcattering up and down in other parts of the World, tho≈øe that are ready at all times, and be≈øt adapted to defend it, and put them upon a temptation by their nece≈ø≈øities and dwelling among≈øt them to turn Papi≈øts. And this al≈øo in a ≈øhort time will carry away the Trade of the Nation (which is now increa≈øing and flouri≈øhing) to other parts of the World that are generally our Enemies; to the utter ruine of the whole Nation, both in Trade and Navigation, and the ≈øacred Religion thereof. And of what evil con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence this will be to the Nobility and Gentry, by bringing down the price of their Lands, may ea≈øily be conceived by an ordinary Capacity.</p>
            <p>Again, If this <hi>Injunction</hi> of the one, and <hi>Re≈øtraint</hi> of the other, do pa≈øs into a Law, it will not only de≈øtroy the mo≈øt chief and principal Manufacture of the Nation, whereby ≈øo many Thou≈øand Native <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> get their livelihood and ≈øub≈øi≈øtance, but (which is con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) it may truly be called the <hi>Prote≈øtant Trade,</hi> for it ≈øets to work and employs mo≈øt of the Strangers and Foreign <hi>Prote≈øtants</hi> that fly from the tyrannical Per≈øecutions of the <hi>Papi≈øt</hi>

            <p>But now if it ≈øhall plea≈øe the <hi>Parliament</hi> in≈øtead of <hi>re≈øtraining</hi> the wear of our own Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, to <hi>prohibit</hi> the wearing of <hi>Silks</hi> and <hi>Stuffs</hi> Manufactured in Foreign Parts, this would certainly inrich and people the Nation, and cau≈øe a greater Con≈øumption of Wool, as al≈øo advance and ≈øtrengthen the Intere≈øt of the <hi>Prote≈øtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will inrich and people the Nation, for that a great deal of the Money that is ≈øent out of the Nation to purcha≈øe the <hi>Silks</hi> and <hi>Stuffs</hi> Foreign Manufactured, will be kept among us; as al≈øo all that Money that is paid to Workmen abroad for the Manufucturing of the≈øe <hi>Silks</hi> and <hi>Stuffs,</hi> will be earned by the Natives and Strangers in <hi>England,</hi> and ≈øo make way for the Employment of many Thou≈øands more than is in the Nation.</p>
            <p>It will al≈øo increa≈øe the Con≈øumption of <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Wool abundantly, for that there being more expence of Silk, becau≈øe of the Manufacturing of tho≈øe Silks here that u≈øe to come from other Parts, there will be al≈øo far greater quantities of Cloths made of <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Wool exported in exchange for Silk; and be≈øides the expence of <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Wool will not only be increa≈øed by the exportation of more Cloths, but a great deal more than is will be worn in <hi>England,</hi> and the Plantations belonging thereunto, by this means; for that Foreign Silks that come ready wrought from other Parts, e≈øpecially from <hi>Holland, France,</hi> and <hi>Ea≈øt-India,</hi> with their painted Calicoes, are generally ≈ølight and very cheap, and ≈øet up the meaner ≈øort of People (as Maid-Servants, and others) in the garbs of Gentry, which otherwi≈øe would wear the decent, u≈øeful, and profitable wear of Cloth, Ker≈øies, and other Stuffs made of Wool, as they would al≈øo do in the Plantations, for that our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Silks being generally rich and well made Silks, they cannot ≈øo well go to the price of them, and that this prohibition of Foreign-wrought Silks will certainly promote the Con≈øumption of Wool, is manife≈øt by Experience; for ≈øince the late good Act was made for the prohibiting of <hi>French</hi> Silks,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55260:3"/>(which it's hoped this <hi>Parliament</hi> will renew) there has been greater quantities of raw Silk imported, as al≈øo greater quantities of Woollen Cloths exported, than was in former years; be≈øides, greater numbers of People employed, both Native and Foreign <hi>Prote≈øtants,</hi> to the great benefit of the Nation; which expence of <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Wool has been chiefly occa≈øioned from this cau≈øe, that more Silks has been made here in that time than before; which is an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Argument to prove, that the more Silks are worn in <hi>England</hi> if Manufactured here, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>he greater is the Con≈øumption of <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Wool, for ≈øuch per≈øon as wears a Silk Garment, doth certainly expend more <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Wool (that being the return of Woollen Cloth) than twenty Gentlemen that wears Cloth made of <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Wool, and fine <hi>Dutch</hi> Cloths: And in all probability, if Silks Manufactured here were encouraged, and Silks Foreign, made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to be worn, it would reduce and bring back the whole Trade of the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture into <hi>England</hi> in, a little time, by preventing the exportation of Wool, for if Wool yeild as good or better price here than it doth in other Parts, as it will do if there be more occa≈øion for it, it will not be tran≈øported as now it is to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> by which means they gain a con≈øiderable ≈øhare of our Woollen Trade, to their great benefit both at home and abroad, and to our great lo≈øs and detriment.</p>
